# FlattingApp

#Abstract
The task for this assignment is to design an application for successfully
managing, coordinating, and communicating within flats. Our group has jointly
made decisions for design in accordance with the description and requirements
provided by FlatMate Ltd. The central idea for this application is to help its
users manage their flat activities and expedite communication between the
flatmate and the manager of a flat.
The report consists of several parts, the most important of which is the
Preliminary Design. The Preliminary Design part explains the rationale behind
some of the pre-formed design alternatives and highlights their respective
strengths and weaknesses. Also, Preliminary Design makes a good
demonstration of the requirements that are provided by FlatMate Ltd.

#Introduction
The experience of living in a flat with someone could be stressful, and people in
a flat may face a myriad of troubles that involve communicating with each other
