# FlattingApp

# Abstract
The task for this assignment is to design an application for successfully
managing, coordinating, and communicating within flats. Our group has jointly
made decisions for design in accordance with the description and requirements
provided by FlatMate Ltd. The central idea for this application is to help its
users manage their flat activities and expedite communication between the
flatmate and the manager of a flat.
The report consists of several parts, the most important of which is the
Preliminary Design. The Preliminary Design part explains the rationale behind
some of the pre-formed design alternatives and highlights their respective
strengths and weaknesses. Also, Preliminary Design makes a good
demonstration of the requirements that are provided by FlatMate Ltd.

# Introduction
The experience of living in a flat with someone could be stressful, and people in
a flat may face a myriad of troubles that involve communicating with each other

# User and Task Identification

# Preliminary Design and Rationale
with pros and cons

# Final User Interface Specification

# Conclusion
After investigating the user's demands, and making assumptions about the
functions that users may use, our team finally determined and designed the
above-mentioned human-computer interaction interface.
The communication feature is an important way to strengthen communication
between roommates and improve the management of occupants. This is because
most of the issues are caused by a lack of communication. Therefore, the
communication feature is considered the most important feature in our design,
which is why it is shown on the home page.
The other feature is used to help users manage their flats, and establish an easy
way for the user to deal with their payment. These features are also designed to
be shown as small buttons on the home page. Despite those main tasks, several
useful functionalities are also designed for improving user experiments.
The final design combined the best concepts of the previous two alternatives,
and shortcomings were removed to achieve a better final design. As a result, the
preliminary design at the final stage is the preferred design for our group and
has satisfied the requirement from FlatMate Ltd.
